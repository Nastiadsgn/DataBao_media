            <!-- Article Body -->
            <div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody">
                <div class="container container-reading">
                    <p><strong>When the Pentagon looks at the future of warfare</strong>—at the autonomous drones swarming over Ukrainian battlefields, at the A.I. systems that could one day command entire military operations—it sees a troubling dependency lurking beneath the surface: batteries.</p>

                    <p>Not just any batteries. The advanced lithium-ion cells that power everything from military drones to the massive data centers training the next generation of artificial intelligence. And overwhelmingly, those batteries come from one place: China.</p>

                    <p>The numbers are stark. In the first three quarters of 2024, China supplied roughly 70 percent of the lithium-ion batteries imported into the United States, a share that has grown even as Washington has tried to reduce its reliance on Beijing for critical technologies.</p>

                    <h2>A Strategic Vulnerability</h2>

                    <p>The battery problem sits at the intersection of several of Washington's biggest anxieties: the rise of A.I., the transformation of modern warfare, and the economic competition with China that has come to define American foreign policy.</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "We are in a strategic competition, and batteries are now a strategic commodity. This isn't about electric cars anymore."
                        <cite>— Former Pentagon official</cite>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>For the defense industry, the concern is immediate. Modern military systems are increasingly battery-dependent. The drones that have become central to the war in Ukraine run on lithium-ion batteries. So do the portable electronics that soldiers carry, the backup power systems on naval vessels, and the grid-scale storage that military bases are building to ensure they can operate even when power grids fail.</p>

                    <h2>Silicon Valley's Power Problem</h2>

                    <p>But it's not just the Pentagon that's worried. In Silicon Valley, the race to build more powerful A.I. systems is running headlong into an energy problem that batteries are increasingly being called on to solve.</p>

                    <p>The data centers that train large language models like GPT-4 and its successors consume enormous amounts of electricity. As these systems grow more sophisticated, their energy demands are growing faster than the power grid can expand. Battery storage is becoming essential to smooth out supply and demand, and to allow data centers to run on renewable energy without interruption.</p>

                    <div class="pull-quote">
                        <p>"Every major tech company is now in the battery business whether they know it or not."</p>
                        <cite>Energy analyst at Wood Mackenzie</cite>
                    </div>

                    <p>Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Meta have all announced major investments in battery storage for their data centers. But the batteries they're buying overwhelmingly come from Chinese manufacturers like CATL and BYD, companies that have built massive scale advantages over American and European competitors.</p>

                    <h2>How China Built Its Lead</h2>

                    <p>China's dominance in batteries didn't happen by accident. It was the result of decades of industrial policy, massive government subsidies, and a willingness to accept losses in the short term to build market share.</p>

                    <p>Starting in the early 2010s, Beijing poured billions into battery research and manufacturing as part of its push to dominate the electric vehicle industry. Chinese companies built enormous factories—so-called gigafactories—that could produce batteries at scales and costs that Western competitors couldn't match.</p>

                    <p>Today, China controls roughly 80 percent of global battery cell manufacturing capacity. It also dominates the supply chains for critical battery materials, processing the vast majority of the world's lithium, cobalt, and graphite into the refined forms that battery makers need.</p>

                    <h2>Washington's Response</h2>

                    <p>The Biden administration has tried to address the battery gap through a combination of industrial policy and trade restrictions. The Inflation Reduction Act included billions in subsidies for domestic battery manufacturing, and new rules require electric vehicles to use batteries made in North America to qualify for federal tax credits.</p>

                    <p>But the scale of China's lead is daunting. Even with the new subsidies, analysts estimate it will take until at least 2030 for the United States to produce enough batteries domestically to meet a meaningful share of demand.</p>

                    <p>Meanwhile, the Defense Department has launched its own initiatives to secure battery supplies for military applications. The Pentagon has invested in several American battery startups and is working to establish a domestic supply chain for military-grade cells.</p>

                    <h2>The Road Ahead</h2>

                    <p>For now, the uncomfortable reality is that both the Pentagon's vision of future warfare and Silicon Valley's A.I. ambitions depend heavily on Chinese technology.</p>

                    <p>Some experts argue that this interdependence actually reduces the risk of conflict—that China would be reluctant to cut off supplies that American companies depend on when Chinese manufacturers depend equally on American customers. Others see it as a strategic vulnerability that Beijing could exploit in a crisis.</p>

                    <p>What seems clear is that batteries have joined semiconductors and rare earth minerals on the list of technologies that policymakers see as too important to leave to the market alone. The question is whether Washington's efforts to build domestic capacity will succeed before the next generation of A.I. systems and autonomous weapons comes online.</p>

                    <p>"This is a race," said one defense industry executive who spoke on condition of anonymity. "And right now, we're behind."</p>
