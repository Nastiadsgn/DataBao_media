            <!-- Article Body -->
            <div class="article-body" itemprop="articleBody">
                <div class="container container-reading">
                    <p><strong>SAN FRANCISCO</strong> — In a move that analysts say could reshape the enterprise analytics landscape, DataBao and Salesforce announced a strategic partnership on Wednesday that will deeply integrate the two companies' platforms.</p>

                    <p>Under the multiyear agreement, DataBao's real-time analytics capabilities will be embedded directly into Salesforce's suite of customer relationship management tools. Salesforce customers will be able to access DataBao's advanced analytics without leaving the Salesforce interface, while DataBao gains access to Salesforce's massive installed base of enterprise users.</p>

                    <p>The financial terms were not disclosed, but people familiar with the matter said the deal includes a significant upfront payment from Salesforce and a revenue-sharing arrangement for jointly acquired customers.</p>

                    <h2>A Meeting of Giants</h2>

                    <p>"This is about meeting customers where they already are," said Michael Torres, DataBao's chief executive, at a joint press conference at Salesforce's San Francisco headquarters. "Salesforce is the system of record for customer data at thousands of enterprises. We can now help those customers unlock insights they've never been able to access before."</p>

                    <blockquote>
                        "When your CRM can tell you not just what happened, but what's about to happen, that changes everything about how you run a business."
                        <cite>— Marc Benioff, Salesforce CEO</cite>
                    </blockquote>

                    <p>Marc Benioff, Salesforce's founder and chief executive, described the partnership as a natural fit. "DataBao has built something remarkable in real-time analytics," he said. "Our customers have been asking for exactly this kind of capability."</p>

                    <h2>Integration Details</h2>

                    <p>The integration will roll out in phases over the next 12 months. The first phase, expected in Q1 2025, will allow Salesforce users to pull DataBao analytics dashboards directly into their Salesforce workflow. Later phases will include predictive analytics for sales pipelines, customer churn prediction, and real-time revenue forecasting.</p>

                    <div class="pull-quote">
                        <p>"We're not just adding a tab in Salesforce. We're fundamentally rethinking what a CRM can tell you about your business."</p>
                        <cite>Priya Sharma, DataBao CTO</cite>
                    </div>

                    <p>The companies will establish a joint engineering team of approximately 50 people, split between San Francisco and DataBao's headquarters in Palo Alto. Priya Sharma, DataBao's chief technology officer, will oversee the technical integration.</p>

                    <h2>Market Implications</h2>

                    <p>The partnership could have significant implications for the broader enterprise software market. DataBao has long positioned itself as a platform-agnostic analytics tool, integrating with dozens of enterprise systems. But the depth of the Salesforce partnership suggests a closer alignment that could make competing integrations less compelling.</p>

                    <p>"This is a shot across the bow at Tableau and the other analytics players in the Salesforce ecosystem," said Brent Leary, an analyst at CRM Essentials. "DataBao is essentially becoming a preferred partner."</p>

                    <p>Salesforce acquired Tableau, the business intelligence company, in 2019 for $15.7 billion. But Tableau has struggled to maintain its momentum in the face of competition from newer analytics platforms like DataBao and Databricks.</p>

                    <h2>Customer Reactions</h2>

                    <p>Early reactions from enterprise customers have been positive. Several major Salesforce customers who were briefed on the partnership before the announcement said they were eager to pilot the integration.</p>

                    <p>"We've been running DataBao and Salesforce side by side for two years," said the chief technology officer of a Fortune 500 retailer who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly. "Having them integrated natively is going to save us enormous amounts of time and complexity."</p>

                    <p>The partnership also includes go-to-market collaboration, with Salesforce's massive sales force trained to sell DataBao's capabilities as part of the broader Salesforce platform. For DataBao, which has roughly 200 salespeople worldwide, access to Salesforce's distribution network could significantly accelerate growth.</p>

                    <h2>Competitive Landscape</h2>

                    <p>The announcement comes as competition in the enterprise analytics space intensifies. Snowflake, Databricks, and Microsoft's Power BI are all vying for enterprise customers, and partnerships with major CRM and ERP vendors have become a key battleground.</p>

                    <p>Earlier this year, Databricks announced a similar partnership with Oracle, while Snowflake has expanded its integration with SAP. The DataBao-Salesforce alliance creates another powerful combination in an increasingly consolidated market.</p>

                    <p>"We're seeing the analytics market mature into a few major platform ecosystems," said Matt Turck, a managing director at FirstMark Capital. "The winners are going to be the companies that can offer both best-of-breed technology and deep integration with the systems customers already use."</p>

                    <h2>Looking Ahead</h2>

                    <p>DataBao executives said the Salesforce partnership was the first of several major platform alliances the company plans to announce in 2025. The company has previously integrated with Microsoft, SAP, and Oracle products, but those integrations have been more limited in scope.</p>

                    <p>"This is the template for how we think about partnerships going forward," Torres said. "Deep integration, joint engineering, shared go-to-market. That's the model that creates real value for customers."</p>

                    <p>Shares of DataBao rose 6 percent in afternoon trading following the announcement. Salesforce shares were up 2 percent.</p>
